Greetings, future employer! 🤗

I'm a highly motivated individual with experience in Amazon, Ada Academy and UniCredit Bank. 💻
At Amazon, I was in charge of optimizing operational expenses and developing new products. 💰
At Ada Academy, I honed my skills in React, writing multi-page task management platforms with interactive and user-friendly features. 💻💡
I have a passion for technology and a strong drive to continue learning and growing in my career. 🚀
Let's connect and see where we can take our careers together! 😁
